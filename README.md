# ErrorHandling
The Solidity code defines a smart contract named `ErrorHandling`. This contract demonstrates various error handling mechanisms in Solidity, including `require`, `assert`, and `revert`. 

In the `testRequire` function, a `require` statement is used to check a condition. If the condition is not met (in this case, if `_value` is not greater than 10), the transaction will revert, and the provided error message "Value must be greater than 0" will be displayed. If the condition is met, `_value` is assigned to the contract's `value` state variable.

The `performAssertion` function contains an `assert` statement. Unlike `require`, which is typically used for validating user inputs and conditions, `assert` is used for checking internal consistency. In this case, it checks if `a` is greater than `b`. If the condition is false, the contract will throw an exception and halt, as it indicates a critical internal error.

Lastly, the `performRevert` function uses the `revert` statement within an `if` block. If the condition `a < b` evaluates to true, the transaction will revert with the error message "A is less than B," providing a custom error message for the revert.

These error handling mechanisms help developers manage unexpected conditions and state changes within their smart contracts, enhancing security and reliability.
